1.What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round-robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.
a. EXPDISTSCHED

Advantages:
1.The random number generated by the exponential distribution allows all processes a chance to execute, preventing starvation. It randomly selects processes regardless of their priority, ensuring that all have the opportunity to be scheduled.
2.It doesn't require processes to finish executing completely; instead, it can preempt the current process based on the random value and pick another process from the ready queue that matches the generated priority.

Disadvantages:
1.The design is complex and may be overly optimistic for real-time applications.
2.Due to the nature of the exponential distribution, the random values generated tend to cluster around the mean, which often results in lower-priority processes being scheduled more frequently than higher-priority ones.

b. LINUXSCHED

Advantages:
1.By allocating each process a specific quantum of time to execute during each epoch, this scheduling policy is fair.
2.It prevents starvation by allowing any unused CPU time allocated to a process to carry over into the next epoch.

Disadvantages:
1.Maintaining the goodness values of each process can be quite complicated.
2.There is increased overhead due to the need to calculate goodness scores and quantum during rescheduling.

c. XINU Round Robin Scheduling

Advantages:
1.The implementation is straightforward and easy to understand.
2.Higher-priority processes are executed first, ensuring their timely completion.

Disadvantages:
1.This focus on higher-priority processes can lead to the starvation of lower-priority ones.
2.Unlike EXPDISTSCHED or LINUXSCHED, it is not as fair, as it can favor higher-priority tasks over others.

2.Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.
a. EXPDISTSCHED
The NULL process executes when there are no higher-priority processes that need to be scheduled, allowing the CPU to remain active. When a non-NULL process requires scheduling, it takes priority over the NULL process.

b. LINUXSCHED
The NULL process is scheduled to run for an entire epoch if there are no other processes available in the ready queue during that epoch.

c. XINU Round Robin scheduling
The NULL process runs whenever there are no other processes in the ready queue.
